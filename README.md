# ESP32 Smart Clock 
This is my Embedded System Design Semester Project. I am using the ESP32 platform to make a LCD clock that displays time synchronised from an NTP server and current weather forecasts from a HTTP based weather API. This repository contains all the subcomponents, design files, and source code for this system. It is designed to work out of the box. 

## Using this application
This application is created in the esp-idf framework. The toolchain, compiler, drivers, all can be installed locally here: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/

This application was developed on a Windows system, and the windows installer: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/windows-setup.html can be found here that automates the setup process. 
Upon installation and following these steps, a ESP_IDF 4.x CMD utility will be installed, which is a development environment for esp-idf based projects. Open this. I used version 4.4, but a newer version may be available upon completion of this project.
```console
./install.sh 
./export
cd projects
git clone 
idf.py fullclean
idf.py build
```

## Testing
To verify that the system components work as designed, a /test directory is created that compiles into a testing environment based on the Unity framework for unit testing. Each component also has a /test subdirectory, ie. /components/net_ctlr/test that has defined Test cases with the unity macro: TEST_CASE("Test_name", "[args]")
